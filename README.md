## My process

### Built with

- React Router Dom - For seamless Navigation
- Tailwind CSS - CSS Utility library
- Zustand - State management library
- TypeScript - To add Type Safety features
- React Hook Form - For Form Validation
- React - JS library

### What I learned

1. Zustand State Management:

- I learned how to efficiently manage state using Zustand, leveraging a single store setup and custom hooks for seamless state updates and access.

2. React Hook Form for Form Validation:

- I learned how to streamline form validation with React Hook Form, employing its lightweight API to set up validation rules and provide real-time feedback for improved user interaction.

### Continued development

I plan to continue refining my skills in React and it's useful library. Without forgetting to increase my skillset and my overall efficiency in the stack.
